## Lessons
-Domain should not reference any other layer
-Application can have it's own interface folder to avoid using Domain's
-Value object represents a concept, like a file naming patter, a file extension...etc
- No identity (no ID or unique reference)
- Immutable (once created, never changes)
- Equality by value (not by reference)
- Self-validating (can enforce rules in constructor)
-Commands should only hold data no logic
-A Command is a representation of an intent
-you can use provider.GetRequiredService to inject constructor at top level

09/23/25 - project hours: 5 hours
- always use interface, and register them with <interface,implementation>
- if you need to use them at the top level use provider.GetRequiredServices<interface> instead of new

09/30/25 - project hours: 8 hours
- use docker command build with period at end like ex: docker build -t file-renamer .
- with run remember to use -it to have it interactive in command line: docker run -it file-renamer
- finished MVP need to write test
